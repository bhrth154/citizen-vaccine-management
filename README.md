# citizen-vaccine-management

-	Used postman tool for handling REST based APIs which allows user to register and login on the application and the details will be stored in the Postgres database.
-	There are 2 types of admins (local and global) local can only change info related to their specific centre whereas Global admins can add new vaccination centres.
-	Users can search for the nearest vaccination centre by either using pin code or by selecting a district and all these can be done with separate APIs for each.
